# Keras-in-cosmology

Deep Learning is quite good at classifying topological patterns. 
In cosmology, there are a lot of patterns which have clues for finding cosmological parameters. 

This repository is for a project to study how A.I. can scientfically discern cosmological patterns. 

See the wiki for details.
